A project birthed from the desire to be given as a gift to a loved one who once found inspiration in the machinations of typography designer Mankun Guo. Guo created a font generator—more accurately, a degenerator—based on cellular automata, where a bitmapped code is slowly degraded by a fractal equation until it no longer resembles itself.

Our goal is to take that concept and rebuild it from the ground up:
to integrate this process into a functional UI, host it on a website, and ultimately present it as a gift to Ryane Johnson on December 25th.

What began as curiosity and admiration has become a collaborative effort to recreate a system where typography mutates, collapses, and reforms—turning a technical experiment into something personal and meaningful.
